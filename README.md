# TShop E-Commerce Web Application

Web application project for CSCI-3900 Web Application Development. The initial README file contains the base information that is needed to accomplish the tasks in Sprint 0 including that of a mock-up web page that will be worked on throughout the course of the project life cycle, implementing code to complete the overall design of the application.

The initial commit for this project is the baseline django structure needed to build out the web application for Sprints 1, 2, and 3.
